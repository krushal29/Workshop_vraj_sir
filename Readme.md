# Strands Agents Hands-On Workshop
**AWS Community Day — 26 September 2026 — 4 hours**

Audience: mixed beginner→intermediate. Format: hands-on, attendees code on own
laptops. Primary model: local Ollama (`qwen3.5:4b`). Fallback: Amazon Bedrock
(swap `OllamaModel` → `BedrockModel`, one line, covered in Module 5).

**Teaching approach**: don't read Strands like a book — read it like an
architecture spec. Every module below follows one pattern:

```
Problem → Concept → Abstraction → Minimal code → Execution flow → Failure modes → Production implications
```

Each module opens with the **5 Questions** (what problem does this solve,
what's the abstraction, what's the minimum code, what happens internally,
when would you NOT use it) before any script runs. The code is the *proof*
of the mental model, not the starting point.

If an attendee can point at any box in this diagram and say what it does
and which script demonstrated it, the workshop worked. That's the bar —
not "did they memorize the API."

The agent loop itself (draw this on Module 1's whiteboard):

```
User → Agent → LLM ─┬─ final answer ──────────► User
                     └─ tool call → Tool → Tool result → LLM ─┬─ another tool
                                                                └─ final answer
```

Every module from here is one branch of this loop getting deeper.

## Pre-Workshop (send 3-5 days before, not during the 4 hours)

Attendees must arrive with this done — do not spend workshop time on installs.

**setup.md to distribute:**
1. Install `uv` (Python package manager): https://docs.astral.sh/uv/
2. Install Ollama: https://ollama.ai
3. `ollama pull qwen3.5:4b` (~3.4GB — do this on home wifi, not conference wifi)
4. `ollama pull nomic-embed-text` (274MB)
5. Clone/download workshop repo, `uv sync` (run from repo root, once — all
   module folders share the same `.venv`)
6. Verify: `ollama list` shows both models; `uv run 0-verify_setup.py` prints OK
7. Minimum hardware: 8GB RAM, GPU strongly preferred — `qwen3.5:4b` fits fully
   on most consumer GPUs (confirmed 100% GPU in testing), CPU-only is usable
   but slower. If a laptop can't run it at all, pair with a neighbor or use
   the Bedrock fallback path in Module 5.
8. Optional: if using the Bedrock fallback, also follow
   `workshop/08-production/BEDROCK_SETUP.md` beforehand (AWS CLI config +
   model access grant can take time to clear — see that doc's known issues).

Write `0-verify_setup.py` (repo root): pings ollama, runs one trivial
`agent("say OK")` call, confirms strands import + model reachable. Catches
env problems before minute 1.

**Folder layout** — matches the 8-stage reading order from SDK-Reading.md.
Run each script from inside its own folder, some write relative-path files
like `tools/` or `mem0_data/`:
```
workshop/
  Readme.md                          this file
  model_provider.py                    shared: Ollama primary, Bedrock fallback
  test_model_provider.py               unit tests for the fallback logic
  01-quickstart/                       Stage 1 — Agent/model/tools shape
    1-structured_output.py
  02-agent-loop/                       Stage 2 — the loop itself
    1-weather_forecaster.py
  03-tools/                            Stage 3 — custom, vended, agent-as-tool
    1-file_operations.py
    2-teachers_assistant.py
  04-model-providers/                  Stage 4 — concept only, see below
  05-state-memory/                     Stage 5 — session vs long-term memory
    1-knowledge_base_agent.py
    2-memory_agent.py
  06-mcp/                              Stage 6 — MCP server/client
    1-mcp_calculator.py
  07-multi-agent/                      Stage 7 — Workflow, Graph
    1-agents_workflows.py
    2-graph_loops.py
  08-production/                       Stage 8 — deployment, meta-tooling, vision
    1-meta_tooling.py
    2-multimodal_optional.py
    BEDROCK_SETUP.md
    MODEL_PRICING.md
```

`04-model-providers` has no dedicated script — it's a concept-only stage per
SDK-Reading.md ("don't spend hours studying every provider"). The
abstraction it teaches (`Agent` doesn't change when the model does) is
proven live in `08-production` when `model_provider.py` swaps Ollama for
Bedrock — same code, different backend.

## Module 1 — Agent Basics & the Agent Loop (45 min)

### The 5 Questions (answer before opening any file)
1. **What problem does this solve?** Turning an LLM (stateless text-in,
   text-out) into something that can *act* — call functions, return
   structured data, chain steps — without you hand-writing that control flow.
2. **What's the abstraction?** `Agent(model=model, tools=tools)`, then
   `result = agent("do something")`. Three moving parts: model, tools, the
   loop that ties them together.
3. **What's the minimum code?** `01-quickstart/1-structured_output.py` —
   nine lines to a working agent.
4. **What happens internally?** Prompt → Agent → Model → (tool call? →
   Tool → Tool result → Model again) → final answer → User. This *is* the
   agent loop — draw it, don't just say it.
5. **When would you NOT use an agent?** When the task is a fixed, known
   sequence of steps with no reasoning or branching needed — that's just a
   function. Agents earn their cost when the *next step depends on what
   just happened*.

### Run it
- **[10min] Concept**: Strands runs inside your own process — it's a
  library, not a hosted platform. That's why `OllamaModel`/`BedrockModel`
  are interchangeable: the agent logic doesn't change when the model
  provider does (this becomes the whole point of Module 5).
- **[10min] Demo + run**: `01-quickstart/1-structured_output.py` — agent
  returns a validated Pydantic object instead of raw text. Why this beats
  regex-parsing LLM output: the model is *constrained* to the schema, not
  hoping its text matches a pattern you wrote after the fact.
- **[10min] Demo + run**: `02-agent-loop/1-weather_forecaster.py` — single
  agent, HTTP tools (`strands.vended_tools.http_request`/`web_fetch`),
  autonomous multi-step API chaining. Best "wow" opener — real API, real
  data, the agent visibly reasons through 2 HTTP calls unprompted. This is
  the agent loop from the architecture map, live.
- **[15min] Exercise**: attendees modify `1-weather_forecaster.py` to answer
  a different city, then add a second tool of their choice and get the
  agent to use both. Ask them to predict, before running: *will the agent
  call both tools, or just one?* — then verify. This builds the "what
  happens internally" muscle.

**Failure mode to mention**: an agent with no tools and a vague prompt will
confidently make things up rather than admit it doesn't know — the loop
still runs, it just never branches into a tool call. Tools aren't optional
plumbing, they're what keeps the loop honest.

Checkpoint: everyone has run ≥2 working agents and can draw the agent loop
from memory by 1:00.

---

## Module 2 — Tools: Custom, Vended, MCP, Agent-as-Tool (50 min)

### The 5 Questions
1. **What problem does this solve?** An LLM alone can't read a file, call an
   API, or run code. Tools are the mechanism through which an agent moves
   beyond text generation into acting on external systems.
2. **What's the abstraction?** Four mechanisms, one interface — the agent
   doesn't care which kind of tool it's calling:
   ```
                    TOOLS
                      │
          ┌───────────┼────────────┐
          │           │            │
        Custom      Vended        MCP
         Tools       Tools        Tools
          │           │            │
          └───────────┼────────────┘
                      │
                Agent-as-tool
   ```
3. **What's the minimum code?** `@tool` decorator on a plain function —
   `03-tools/2-teachers_assistant.py`'s `math_assistant` is the clearest
   example (an agent wrapped as a tool for another agent).
4. **What happens internally?** Model decides "I need tool X" → emits a
   structured tool call → Strands executes it → result goes back into the
   conversation → model continues. The model never runs code itself, it
   only ever asks Strands to.
5. **When would you NOT use MCP specifically?** If the function is local,
   simple, and tightly coupled to this one application — a custom `@tool`
   function is simpler than standing up a protocol server for it. MCP earns
   its cost when the tool needs to be *reusable across different agents/apps*.

### Run it
- **[10min] Demo**: `03-tools/1-file_operations.py` —
  `file_read`/`file_write`/`editor` (vended tools). Flag the Windows gotcha
  up front (`BYPASS_TOOL_CONSENT`) so nobody hits the console-hang bug live.
- **[15min] Demo + run**: `03-tools/2-teachers_assistant.py` — the
  **agent-as-tool** pattern: one orchestrator routing to specialist agents
  wrapped as tools. This is the centerpiece of the module — walk the `@tool`
  decorator carefully, this pattern reappears as the foundation of Module 3.
- **[10min] Demo**: `06-mcp/1-mcp_calculator.py` — MCP server/client.
  **Tool vs MCP, the distinction that matters**:
  ```
  Custom Tool → function inside your application
  MCP         → standard protocol → external tool server → reusable capability
  ```
  Needs two terminals — pre-start both before demoing, don't fumble it live.
- **[15min] Exercise**: attendees add a 3rd specialist agent to the
  Teacher's Assistant and get the orchestrator to route to it correctly.

**Failure mode to mention**: a tool with an ambiguous docstring gets called
at the wrong time, or not at all — the model routes on the tool's
*description*, not its implementation. A bad tool description is a bug,
even if the function itself is correct.

Checkpoint: everyone has a working multi-tool orchestrator and can state the
tool-vs-MCP distinction unprompted by 1:50.

## Break (10 min)
Good spot — Module 3 has the heaviest concepts of the day.

---

## Module 3 — Multi-Agent Patterns (50 min)

### The 5 Questions
1. **What problem does this solve?** One agent, one system prompt, one
   toolset gets unwieldy fast — mixing "research the web" and "write
   polished prose" logic in one prompt fights itself. Splitting into
   specialized agents that hand off work keeps each one simple.
2. **What's the abstraction?** Two patterns today, ordered by how much
   control you give up:
   ```
   Workflow:  A → B → C → D          (deterministic, you wrote the order)
   Graph:     A → (B|C) → D           (dynamic routing, conditions decide)
   ```
   (Agents-as-Tools from Module 2 is actually the third pattern — you
   already built it.)
3. **What's the minimum code?** String-chaining agent outputs —
   `07-multi-agent/1-agents_workflows.py`'s `run_research_workflow`
   function is three `Agent()` calls in sequence, nothing fancier.
4. **What happens internally?** Workflow: no magic, each agent's output
   becomes the next agent's input, full stop. Graph: `GraphBuilder` adds
   *conditions* on edges — a node's result decides which edge fires next,
   which is how a revise-loop becomes possible.
5. **When would you NOT use a graph?** If the steps are always the same
   order with no branching, Workflow is simpler and has nothing to debug —
   graphs earn their complexity when the *next step depends on evaluating
   the last one's output*.

### Run it
- **[15min] Demo + run**: `07-multi-agent/1-agents_workflows.py` —
  sequential pipeline (Researcher→Analyst→Writer). Emphasize
  `callback_handler=None` and that this is the simplest multi-agent
  pattern that exists: no framework magic, just passing strings.
- **[20min] Demo + run**: `07-multi-agent/2-graph_loops.py` —
  write/review/revise loop with `GraphBuilder`, a deterministic non-LLM node
  (`QualityChecker`), loop guards (`max_node_executions`,
  `execution_timeout`). Hardest concept today — draw the graph on a
  whiteboard/slide *before* showing code:
  ```
        writer
          │
          ▼
   quality_checker ──REVISE──► back to writer
          │
       APPROVED
          │
          ▼
      finalizer
  ```
- **[15min] Exercise**: attendees change `QualityChecker`'s `min_words`
  threshold and observe the loop behavior change; stretch goal — add a
  second deterministic check (e.g. banned-word filter).

**Failure mode to mention**: a graph with no execution guard can loop
forever if the condition never resolves to "done" — `max_node_executions`
and `execution_timeout` aren't optional safety theater, they're the only
thing standing between a bug and an infinite bill (doubly true once this
runs against a paid model instead of free local Ollama).

Checkpoint: everyone has seen a working feedback loop graph and can explain
why the loop guard exists by 2:50.

---

## Module 4 — State & Memory (40 min)

### The 5 Questions
1. **What problem does this solve?** An LLM call is stateless by default —
   ask it something, get an answer, ask again with no memory of the first.
   Real assistants need to remember facts across separate invocations, not
   just within one conversation.
2. **What's the abstraction?**
   ```
   Agent
    ├── Conversation state   (within one session)
    ├── Session               (one user's ongoing interaction)
    └── Long-term memory       (persists across sessions entirely)
   ```
   Ask, for every memory design: *what does the agent remember, where is it
   stored, when does it disappear, how does a new call access it?*
3. **What's the minimum code?**
   `05-state-memory/1-knowledge_base_agent.py` — explicit, code-defined
   store/retrieve routing. No framework magic, just an if/else and a
   local file-backed `memory` tool call.
4. **What happens internally?** Store: content gets embedded (turned into a
   vector) and saved. Retrieve: the query gets embedded too, and the
   store returns whatever's closest by similarity — this is why the
   *embedding model* matters as much as the chat model.
5. **When would you NOT use vector memory?** If you just need the last N
   messages of *this* conversation, that's session state, not memory — far
   simpler, no embeddings, no vector store. Reach for mem0/vector search
   only when facts need to survive across sessions or be searched by
   meaning rather than recency.

### Run it
- **[10min] Demo**: `05-state-memory/1-knowledge_base_agent.py` —
  code-defined store/retrieve routing, deterministic not tool-autonomous.
  Simpler mental model than mem0, good bridge into it.
- **[20min] Demo (not hands-on — too fragile for 30 laptops at once)**:
  `05-state-memory/2-memory_agent.py` — mem0 + local Ollama embeddings,
  FAISS vector store. Be upfront: this took real debugging to get working
  locally (dimension mismatches inside mem0's own internals — the packaged
  `strands_tools.mem0_memory` tool hardcodes an embedding dimension that
  doesn't match the embedder it's configured with). Show it running, explain
  *why* it needed a hand-rolled config instead of the packaged tool, point
  attendees to the script to try later rather than live-debugging FAISS
  dimension mismatches in front of 30 people.
- **[10min] Demo**: `08-production/1-meta_tooling.py` — agent writes and
  hot-loads its own tool at runtime (this stage jumps ahead to Production
  since meta-tooling is closer to that concern than pure memory — but it's
  a natural, fun closer for the memory module too). Note the small-model
  reliability caveat (local models can be shaky on 3+-step tool chains —
  a real limitation of running small models locally, not a Strands bug).

No exercise this module — mem0 setup fragility makes hands-on risky at scale.
Attendees follow along, ask questions, try it after the workshop.

**Failure mode to mention**: retrieval returning "nothing relevant" isn't
always a bug — if the stored fact and the query don't share enough semantic
similarity (wrong embedding model, too-strict `min_score`), the agent
correctly says "I don't know" about something that *is* in memory. Debug
the retrieval score before assuming the store is broken.

Checkpoint: everyone can explain the store→embed→search→retrieve flow by
3:30, even if they haven't run mem0 themselves.

---

## Module 5 — Production (20 min)

### The 5 Questions
1. **What problem does this solve?** Getting from "works on my laptop" to
   something a team can rely on — different model provider, observability,
   deployment target.
2. **What's the abstraction?** The agent logic doesn't fundamentally change
   when the model provider changes — that's the whole architectural point
   of Module 1 paying off here:
   ```
                    Agent
                      │
                      ▼
               Model Interface
                      │
          ┌───────────┼───────────┐
          │           │           │
       Ollama     Bedrock      OpenAI
          │           │           │
         LLM         LLM         LLM
   ```
3. **What's the minimum code?** `workshop/model_provider.py`'s
   `get_model()` — tries Ollama, falls back to Bedrock (or vice versa) with
   zero changes needed in any of the example scripts that call it.
4. **What happens internally?** Every script imports `get_model()` instead
   of constructing a model directly — the swap happens in one file, once,
   and every script downstream picks it up automatically.
5. **When would you NOT swap to Bedrock?** If local/offline/free is a hard
   requirement (privacy, cost, no reliable internet) — Ollama stays primary.
   Bedrock earns its place when you need bigger models than a laptop can
   run, or don't want every teammate installing and babysitting Ollama.

### Run it
- **[8min]** Show the swap live: `model_provider.py`'s `get_model()` —
  Ollama primary today, Bedrock secondary. Explain *why* fallback logic
  beats a hard model choice: production code shouldn't die because one
  provider had a bad five minutes. Full setup: `08-production/BEDROCK_SETUP.md`.
  **Known status**: Bedrock access is still account-gated as of last test
  (see Known Issues below) — demo the fallback triggering cleanly rather
  than forcing a live Bedrock call if it's still blocked.
- **[7min]** Deployment map — one slide, which target fits which use case:
  ```
  Production Agent
  │
  ├── Bedrock AgentCore   → managed, Bedrock-native
  ├── Docker/Fargate/ECS  → containerized, portable
  ├── Lambda              → event-driven, serverless
  └── EC2/EKS             → full control, most ops overhead
  ```
  Not a deep dive — point at `/docs/user-guide/deploy/` for the real detail.
- **[5min]** Resources: strandsagents.com/docs, repo link, how to reach you.

**Failure mode to mention**: swapping providers silently changes behavior —
different models have different tool-calling reliability (we hit this
directly: a bigger local model wandered off-script and hit a token limit
where a smaller one answered correctly). Never assume "same code, same
provider-swap" means "same output quality" — re-test after every swap.

## Closing: the architect-level mental model (5 min, end of Module 5)

Don't ask attendees to remember individual APIs. Ask them to draw this:

If they can map each box to a script from today, they understand Strands —
they don't need to have memorized the whole API surface.

## Known Issues / Live-Demo Landmines (read before you go live)

- **`08-production/2-multimodal_optional.py`**: local Ollama models used
  here have no vision. Don't demo unless you've pulled a vision model and
  re-tested — currently cut from the agenda entirely, keep it that way
  unless you fix it beforehand. Recommended cheap Bedrock vision model in
  `08-production/MODEL_PRICING.md` if Bedrock access clears in time.
- **`06-mcp/1-mcp_calculator.py`**: needs server running in a separate
  terminal before the client. Pre-start it before your demo block, don't do
  it live.
- **`05-state-memory/2-memory_agent.py`**: works, but only after bypassing
  `strands_tools`' built-in mem0 tool and hand-configuring `mem0.Memory`
  directly (dimension mismatches in the packaged tool). Demo from the
  already-fixed script; if an attendee tries the naive
  `strands_tools.mem0_memory` approach they will hit the same wall you did —
  have the explanation ready.
- **`08-production/1-meta_tooling.py`**: small local models sometimes
  narrate tool calls as text instead of invoking them, or mangle a 3rd
  chained call. The script has a deterministic fallback built in so the
  demo doesn't stall — don't remove it.
- **Model choice matters more than expected**: swapping the local Ollama
  model from `qwen2.5:7b` → `qwen3.5:9b` → `qwen3.5:4b` produced three
  different behaviors — 9b ran partly on CPU (slow, 53%/47% split) and went
  off-script on a simple weather query until it hit a token limit; 4b runs
  100% GPU and stayed on-task. Bigger isn't automatically better for
  tool-calling reliability — test the actual model you'll demo with, not
  just the biggest one you can fit.
- **Windows attendees**: `strands_tools.shell` / `python_repl` import
  POSIX-only modules (`pty`, `fcntl`) and crash on import on Windows. Already
  dropped from `08-production/1-meta_tooling.py` /
  `03-tools/2-teachers_assistant.py`. If any attendee is on Windows and
  adds these tools back in during an exercise, they'll hit this — know the
  fix (drop those two tools) on the spot.
- **`editor`/`file_write` tools**: need `BYPASS_TOOL_CONSENT=true` set before
  they're imported, or they hang on an interactive y/n prompt that breaks
  under most terminals (including Windows). Already set in every script that
  uses them — flag it if attendees copy the pattern into new code.
- **Bedrock**: as of last test, every model/region/API combination tried
  (Anthropic, Qwen, OpenAI, AI21; `ap-south-1` and `us-east-1`;
  InvokeModel/Converse) returns the same account-level
  `ValidationException: Operation not allowed`. The old "Model access"
  console page has been retired — AWS says serverless models auto-enable on
  first invoke, but that isn't triggering for this account. This needs an
  AWS Support case, not a console click. **Don't promise a live Bedrock
  demo** — show the fallback triggering cleanly instead, that's still a
  legitimate and useful thing to demonstrate.

## What Still Needs Doing Before 26 Sep

- [ ] Write `0-verify_setup.py` (setup-check script, see Pre-Workshop section)
- [ ] Write and distribute `setup.md` to registered attendees, 3-5 days out
- [x] Bedrock fallback documented — `08-production/BEDROCK_SETUP.md`
- [ ] Open AWS Support case re: account-wide `Operation not allowed` on
      every Bedrock model — do this soon, support tickets take time
- [ ] Decide: pull a vision model and re-enable the multimodal module, or
      leave cut from agenda (current plan: leave cut, mention it exists)
- [ ] Slides: 1 architecture map (this doc's top section), 1 graph-loop
      diagram, 1 deploy-options comparison — everything else is live code
- [ ] Dry-run the full 4hr flow solo, time each module for real
